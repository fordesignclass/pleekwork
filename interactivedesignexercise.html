<hr>
<p>i'm a student living in kl, studying in taylor's university :3. i live with my brother and his wife, which forces me to 
    commute back and forth from home to campus. not that I hate it, it's just that I could be saving more of my time (sleep) 
    by living nearby. it would also make it easier for me to annoy and hangout with my friends.</p>
<p> i like to draw, but alas the god of responsibilities has frowned upon me. </p>
<p> i can name a few things im struggling with and one of them is trying to keep this paragraph going. i dont know how much mr sams
    wants me to say about myself, i might end this soon. i'm not really one to talk about myself, i'm more of an observer (or a listener) , but
    i don't hate talking. sometimes i converse with grab drivers and we end up having a pretty good time! i get anxious when i try to initiate 
    with people my age (it's a thing), i've had a few conversations with old ladies and they're all nice, not really sure with old men, but i 
    like talking to my lecturers. i dont like having a big circle of friends, i prefer smaller ones since i have a hard time being myself 
    when im in front of a huge crowd, even if i know them. </p>
<p> recently, i've been missing a lot of my friends who are also studying abroad, i haven't gone back to indonesia in almost a year... i miss the food!!!!
    hopefully i get to go home after this semester and take all the food back to malaysia teehee. kind of unrelated but theres 
    surprisingly a lot of indonesian in taylors :o </p>
<p> i also almost didn't go to taylors btw haha that was... something!!!! i'm really glad i've befriended nice people, I seriously 
    thought i wasn't gonna make any friends, and most of them ended up being indonesian... funni stuff 
</p>
<p> anyways enough of that. here are some things i like:</p>
<ul>
<li> gacha games.. (without the gambling addiction) </li>
<li> rice on</li>
<li> stupid looking things, in the cute/funny sense </li>
<li> collecting pins.. :D i like to give them out as gifts if i can afford them</li>
</ul>
<p> that is all thankkk youuuuu :3</p>
